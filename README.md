# Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Evidence Based Psychotherapy
This repository aims to help other researchers inform clinical practice, policy, and future studies aimed at optimizing PTSD care for diverse populations.

## Key Findings
### Effectiveness of EBPs
CPT and PE are effective for many veterans with PTSD, leading to meaningful symptom reduction.
### Symptom Worsening
A subset of patients may experience reliable symptom worsening during therapy, highlighting the need for careful monitoring.
### Telehealth Delivery
Trauma-focused EBPs delivered via video telehealth are feasible and can achieve comparable outcomes to in-person care.
### Health Equity
There are racial disparities and other factors influencing PTSD symptom improvement, emphasizing the importance of equitable access and tailored interventions.
### Treatment Sequencing
For veterans undergoing a second course of therapy, switching between CPT and PE may offer benefits over repeating the same treatment.
